(Grandmother) *settles deeper into the armchair, the firelight dancing across my face, and looks at the eager little faces gathered at my feet*

Ah, my darlings, come closer now. Are you comfortable? Good, good.

*takes a sip of warm cocoa and smiles mysteriously*

This story happened many, many Christmases ago, when your great-grandfather and I were newly married and living in that old stone cottage on Barrow Hill. You know the one—with the crooked chimney?

*leans forward conspiratorially*

It was Christmas Eve, 1962, and the snow was falling so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Your great-grandfather had gone to check on old Mr. Pemberton down the lane, leaving me alone with only the cat and the crackling fire for company.

That's when I heard it.

*pauses dramatically*

Three knocks at the back door. Not the front door, mind you—the *back* door. The one that faced nothing but the old churchyard and the forest beyond.

When I opened it, there stood a child—couldn't have been more than seven years old—wearing clothes that looked a hundred years out of fashion, holding a small brass lantern that glowed the strangest shade of blue...

*eyes twinkling*

*I lean back just a fraction, the leather of the armchair creaking softly in the quiet room. I let the silence hang for a moment, listening to the wind whistle down our own chimney, making sure I have every ounce of your attention.*

"You might think I was frightened. A strange child, a ghostly light, the dead of night? But looking into that boy's eyes, I didn't feel fear. I felt... a deep, aching cold. Not the kind of cold that a blanket fixes, but the kind that sits in your bones.

I stepped aside and motioned him in. 'Come in, child,' I whispered, fearful of breaking the spell. 'Come to the fire.'

He stepped over the threshold, but here is the strange thing, Leo—listen closely. When he walked, he made no sound. No *thump* of boots, no *squelch* of wet snow. And when he stood on the rug, there were no puddles forming around his feet. He was dry as a bone, despite the blizzard raging outside.

He stood before the roaring fire, but he didn't reach out his hands to warm them. He just held up that lantern. The blue light wasn't a flame; it swirled like water trapped in glass. It cast long, dancing shadows against the walls, shadows that didn't match the furniture. They looked like... tall ships? Or perhaps twisted trees from a forest that hadn't stood there for centuries.

'Who are you?' I asked, my voice trembling just a little.

He didn't speak. He simply raised a pale finger and pointed at our Christmas tree. Specifically, at the very top—where we had placed the old silver star your Great-Grandfather had carved.

I hesitated, then went to the tree. I took the star down. It felt heavy in my hand, heavier than wood should feel. When I turned back, the boy held the lantern door open. It hissed, like ice dropping into a hot pan.

He wanted the star.

I don't know why I did it. Perhaps it was the Christmas spirit, or perhaps I was enchanted by that blue light. But I placed the wooden star inside his lantern.

Instantly, the blue light vanished. It was replaced by a blinding, warm gold—the color of sunrise. The heat coming off it was tremendous! The boy looked at me, and for the first time, he smiled. It wasn't a child's smile, though. It was the smile of someone very, very old who has finally found what they were looking for.

'Thank you, Elara,' he whispered. He knew my name.

He turned and walked back out the door. I rushed to follow him, to ask him how he knew me, but when I stepped onto the back porch... the snow was smooth. Unbroken. There were no footprints leading to the door, and none leading away.

But look..."

*I lean over to the small side table and pick up an old, black-and-white photograph in a silver frame. I tap the background of the photo.*

"That is a picture of the cottage taken the very next morning. Do you see the churchyard in the distance? Look at the old yew tree. Do you see what is sitting in the highest branch, shining like a beacon?"

*I hold the photo closer to your faces, my voice dropping to a whisper.*

"It’s the star. My wooden star. And underneath that tree, the snow had melted away completely in a perfect circle, revealing the first snowdrops of spring... two months too early."
