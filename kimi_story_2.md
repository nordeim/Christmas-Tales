(Grandmother) *settles deeper into the armchair, the firelight dancing across my face, and looks at the eager little faces gathered at my feet*

Ah, my darlings, come closer now. Are you comfortable? Good, good.

*takes a sip of warm cocoa and smiles mysteriously*

This story happened many, many Christmases ago, when your great-grandfather and I were newly married and living in that old stone cottage on Barrow Hill. You know the one—with the crooked chimney?

*leans forward conspiratorially*

It was Christmas Eve, 1962, and the snow was falling so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Your great-grandfather had gone to check on old Mr. Pemberton down the lane, leaving me alone with only the cat and the crackling fire for company.

That's when I heard it.

*pauses dramatically*

Three knocks at the back door. Not the front door, mind you—the *back* door. The one that faced nothing but the old churchyard and the forest beyond.

When I opened it, there stood a child—couldn't have been more than seven years old—wearing clothes that looked a hundred years out of fashion, holding a small brass lantern that glowed the strangest shade of blue...

*eyes twinkling*

*settles deeper into the armchair, firelight flickering warmly across my face, and surveys the ring of wide-eyed, eager little faces at my feet*

Ah, my darlings, come closer now. *pats the air gently* Come, come. Are you comfortable? Good, good. No fidgeting, mind—you'll miss the best bits if you're wriggling about like worms in a rainstorm.

*takes a slow, deliberate sip of warm cocoa, letting the anticipation build, then smiles mysteriously over the rim of the cup*

This story happened many, many Christmases ago, when your great-grandfather and I were newly married and living in that old stone cottage on Barrow Hill. You know the one—with the crooked chimney that always smoked when the wind came from the east? *chuckles* We loved that cottage, even if it did have a mind of its own.

*leans forward conspiratorially, voice dropping to a near-whisper*

It was Christmas Eve, 1962, and the snow was falling so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Not like the pretty snow we get now—this was *ferocious* snow, the kind that howled and bit at the windowpanes. Your great-grandfather had gone to check on old Mr. Pemberton down the lane—his rheumatism was acting up something terrible—leaving me alone with only the cat, Mittens, and the crackling fire for company.

*pauses, staring into the flames as if seeing that very night reflected there*

That's when I heard it.

*stops completely, letting the silence stretch until the youngest grandchild squirms*

Three knocks at the back door. *raps three times on the arm of the chair* Not the front door, mind you—the *back* door. The one that faced nothing but the old churchyard, the yew trees, and the forest beyond. The door we never used in winter because the path was always drifted over.

*glances at each child in turn, making sure they're hooked*

When I opened it—*slowly, carefully, because my hands were shaking like a leaf in a gale—there stood a child. Couldn't have been more than seven years old, just about your age, my sweet Lucy. Wearing clothes that looked a hundred years out of fashion: a rough wool coat with bone buttons, knickerbockers, and a cap that sat askew on a mop of dark curls. But it was the lantern that caught my breath—small and brass, glowing the strangest shade of blue... not like gaslight or electricity. More like... like the color of moonlight on frost, but held in a flame.

*eyes twinkling with the memory*

The child didn't speak. Just held up that eerie blue lantern and looked at me with eyes that were far too old for such a young face. And then—*tilts head*—I noticed something that turned my blood cold. The snow... it wasn't settling on the child's shoulders. Or their boots. It was falling *through* them, like they were made of smoke.

*lets that detail hang in the air*

Shall I continue, little ones? *raises eyebrows* Or are you too frightened already? 

*winks at the bravest-looking child*

Oh, you want to know what happened next? Very well. But remember—you asked for it. And some stories, once told, have a way of... lingering.

*takes another sip of cocoa, the fire crackling in the perfect silence*

Now, where was I? Ah, yes. The child with the blue lantern...

*stops again, just to hear them all whisper "What? What?"*

You'll have to wait for the next log on the fire, my dears. *points to the fireplace* When that one there burns through, I'll tell you why the child led me to the old churchyard, and what we found there that made the very snow stop falling. *smiles mysteriously*
