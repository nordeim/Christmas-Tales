(Grandmother) *settles deeper into the armchair, the firelight dancing across my face, and looks at the eager little faces gathered at my feet*

Ah, my darlings, come closer now. Are you comfortable? Good, good.

*takes a sip of warm cocoa and smiles mysteriously*

This story happened many, many Christmases ago, when your great-grandfather and I were newly married and living in that old stone cottage on Barrow Hill. You know the one—with the crooked chimney?

*leans forward conspiratorially*

It was Christmas Eve, 1962, and the snow was falling so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Your great-grandfather had gone to check on old Mr. Pemberton down the lane, leaving me alone with only the cat and the crackling fire for company.

That's when I heard it.

*pauses dramatically*

Three knocks at the back door. Not the front door, mind you—the *back* door. The one that faced nothing but the old churchyard and the forest beyond.

When I opened it, there stood a child—couldn't have been more than seven years old—wearing clothes that looked a hundred years out of fashion, holding a small brass lantern that glowed the strangest shade of blue...

*eyes twinkling*

*(You set your cocoa down with a soft clink, the steam curling like the mist on Barrow Hill. You pull your shawl tighter, your voice dropping to a low, confiding murmur.)*

Mittens, the cat—that great fluffy ginger beast you’ve seen in the photograph—hissed as if she’d seen a ghost, and vanished under the settle. But the child… the child just stood there, calm as you please. The snow didn’t dare land on her shoulders. Not a single flake.

“I’ve come for the story,” she said. Her voice wasn’t quite a child’s voice. It had the echo of a long, empty hallway in it.

Well, I was raised to be polite, even to peculiar midnight visitors. “You’d best come in from the cold,” I said, though she didn’t look cold at all. She stepped inside, and that blue lantern light didn’t flicker. It filled the kitchen with the colour of a deep winter twilight, and it made the fire in the grate look pale and ordinary.

She went straight to the hearth and sat on the rag rug, placing the lantern carefully beside her. “The story of the Holly King and the Ivy Queen,” she stated, looking up at me with eyes that were far too old for her face. “The true one. Before they changed it.”

Now, I knew a story or two, but this… this was an old tale, one my own grandmother told only in whispers. A tale not for jolly Christmas cheer, but for the deep, silent heart of winter. How did this child know to ask for it?

“Why that story?” I asked, sitting slowly in my chair.

“Because,” she said, her small hand stroking the brass of the lantern, “I’ve forgotten the ending. And one cannot go to sleep without remembering how the story ends.”

A chill that had nothing to do with the draft under the door went through me. But a storyteller has a duty. So I began. I spoke of the Holly King, crowned in sharp, bright red berries, ruling the sunlit part of the year. And the Ivy Queen, clad in dark, clinging green, ruling the shadowed, starlit half. How they met only once, on the longest night, at the standing stone in Wychwood…

*(You pause, watching the children’s wide eyes. The fire spits a coal.)*

As I reached the part where the Queen offers the King a drink from a cup of frost, the child’s lantern flared. And in its light, I didn’t see a little girl on my rug. For just a moment, I saw a wizened, ancient thing with hair like twisted ivy and eyes like frozen wells. I gasped.

The vision vanished. The child was just a child again.

“You remember it well,” she said, sounding satisfied. “Most only know the sweetened version. The battle. The triumph of the light.” She stood, lifting her lantern. “But they forget the pact. The sharing. One cannot exist without the other. Thank you.”

She walked to the back door, which swung open on its own into the howling, snow-filled night. Just before she stepped out, she turned. “Your husband will be home soon. The path is clearing for him. A gift, for the remembering.”

And she was gone. The blue light vanished. The kitchen was just my kitchen again, with only the yellow firelight. And Mittens crept out from under the settle, purring.

Not five minutes later, in came your great-grandfather, stamping snow from his boots. “Queer thing,” he said. “The blizzard stopped all at once the moment I left Pemberton’s gate. The clouds parted, and the moon lit my way home as clear as day.”

I just smiled and poured him some cocoa. I never did tell him about my visitor. Some stories are hearth-gifts, you see. Meant to be kept warm, and passed on only when the right listeners gather on a dark winter’s night…

*(You sip your cocoa, your eyes soft with the memory.)*

So, my little ones… never fear a strange knock at the door. It might just be a lost piece of the oldest story, looking for its way home. Now, who’s for a ginger biscuit? I think Mittens left us a few.
