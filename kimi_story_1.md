*settles deeper into the armchair, adjusting the shawl around my shoulders*

Ah, my darlings, you're all stuffed with turkey and pudding, are you? Good, good. Nothing better for storytelling than a full belly and a warm fire. Now, where was I? Oh yes—this reminds me of the Christmas Eve when I was no bigger than little Tommy over there.

*takes a sip of cocoa, eyes twinkling*

It was 1952, and snow had been falling for three days straight—snow so thick it turned the whole world into a secret, you understand? My father's candle-making workshop had frozen shut, and we'd had to bring the goats into the kitchen! But that's not the story. The story—*the magic*—began just as the church bells rang ten o'clock.

*leans forward, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper*

I was supposed to be asleep, of course. But I'd left my window open a crack—just a crack—to listen for sleigh bells. And what I heard instead... well. At first, I thought it was the wind. A high, sweet chiming, like a hundred tiny glass bells. But wind doesn't *shine*, dears. Wind doesn't cast blue and silver shadows across your bedroom floor.

*pauses to poke the fire, making sparks dance*

I tiptoed to the window—and what do you think I saw? There, where our vegetable garden should have been, was a labyrinth of ice. Not just any ice, mind you. These were walls of frozen roses, their petals so perfect you could see the veins in them. And they were *moving*, growing, spiraling outwards like a flower unfurling in fast motion. At the center, hovering just above the frozen ground, was a single, glowing star—no bigger than my thumb—pulsing like a heartbeat.

*looks at each grandchild in turn*

Now, I know what you're thinking. "Granny, you should've woken your parents!" But children, some magic is only meant for those brave enough to step into it alone. And my feet were already in my boots.

*chuckles softly*

The air outside wasn't cold—it was *crisp*, like biting into a winter apple. The ice roses chimed as I passed, each one playing a different note, until I realized they were ringing out "Silent Night." The star at the center pulsed faster, and I understood, somehow, that it was lost. A Christmas star that had tumbled down before the others could follow.

*voice becomes more animated*

That's when I heard the rustling. From behind the ice walls came creatures made of shadow and frosted breath—three of them, with eyes like molten gold. Guardians, I suppose you'd call them. They didn't speak, but I felt their question clear as day: *"Who dares seek the star?"*

My heart was thumping like Father's workshop mallet, but do you know what I did? I curtsied—because my mother had taught me manners even in the face of mystery—and I said, "I'm just a girl who wants to help Christmas find its way."

*folds hands in lap, smiling at the memory*

The shadow creatures parted. The star floated down to rest in my open palm, warm as a living thing. And suddenly I *knew*—the way you just *know* where the Christmas presents are hidden—I knew it needed to be higher. Much higher.

Before I could think better of it, I was climbing the old oak tree, star in one hand, sap freezing on my mittens. The higher I climbed, the lighter the star became, until it was tugging me upwards like a kite caught in the wind. At the very top branch, with the whole white world spread below me, I let it go.

*fingers mimic releasing something into the air*

It shot upward like a firework, but silent—trailing silver sparks that hung in the air and became... well, became the stars you see tonight. Every single one. The ice garden melted in an instant, watering next summer's roses. And I tumbled back into bed just as Father Christmas's sleigh *whooshed* over our roof—so close I saw Vixen's whiskers outlined against the moon.

*leans back, satisfied*

The next morning, my mother scolded me for mittens covered in sap and ice. But tucked into my stocking, along with the orange and the chocolate coin, was a single frozen rose petal. Still perfect. Still chiming, if you held it to your ear.

*reaches into her own pocket now, eyes twinkling with mischief*

I've kept it all these years, of course. Would you like to hear it?

*pretends to hold out something, listening*

Ah. It's gone silent now. It only rings when someone truly believes that magic belongs to the brave. And you, my little loves... I think you just might be brave enough to hear it someday.

*settles back, pulling shawl tighter*

But that's enough for one night. The fire's dying, and tomorrow is Christmas. Time for dreams, not stories. Though—*winks*—sometimes they're the same thing, aren't they?

*gazes at the tree, where a single ornament seems to catch the light just so*
