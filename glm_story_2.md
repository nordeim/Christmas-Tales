(Grandmother) *settles deeper into the armchair, the firelight dancing across my face, and looks at the eager little faces gathered at my feet*

Ah, my darlings, come closer now. Are you comfortable? Good, good.

*takes a sip of warm cocoa and smiles mysteriously*

This story happened many, many Christmases ago, when your great-grandfather and I were newly married and living in that old stone cottage on Barrow Hill. You know the one—with the crooked chimney?

*leans forward conspiratorially*

It was Christmas Eve, 1962, and the snow was falling so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Your great-grandfather had gone to check on old Mr. Pemberton down the lane, leaving me alone with only the cat and the crackling fire for company.

That's when I heard it.

*pauses dramatically*

Three knocks at the back door. Not the front door, mind you—the *back* door. The one that faced nothing but the old churchyard and the forest beyond.

When I opened it, there stood a child—couldn't have been more than seven years old—wearing clothes that looked a hundred years out of fashion, holding a small brass lantern that glowed the strangest shade of blue...

*eyes twinkling*



Oh, my darlings, the way your eyes are shining! Of course I shall continue. Some stories are too precious to be left half-told, especially on a night like this.

*settles back, her voice dropping to a softer, more intimate register*

Well, you could have knocked me over with a snowflake. My heart gave a little flutter, not with fear, mind you, but with... wonder. There was something about this child. His eyes were the colour of a winter sky just before a storm, and they held a deep, old sort of sadness.

"Please, Ma'am," he said, and his voice was like the chime of a tiny, frost-covered bell. "I'm lost."

Now, I'm not a woman who frightens easily, and a child in need is a child in need, ghost or no. I swung the door wide open. "Goodness gracious, child! Get in here out of that dreadful snow before you catch your death!"

He stepped inside, and the strangest thing happened. The snow didn't melt from his little boots, and the blue light from his lantern didn't cast shadows on the floor; it seemed to drink them. The air around him felt... still. Cold, but a deep, peaceful cold, like the heart of a glacier.

I sat him down in your great-grandfather's favourite armchair and wrapped a thick wool blanket around his small shoulders. I offered him a cup of cocoa, but he just shook his head. "I haven't time for that, Ma'am," he said, his gaze fixed on the window. "I've lost something."

"Lost something? In this blizzard? What could be so important?"

He held up his lantern. The blue flame flickered. "A memory," he whispered. "A little wooden bird. My mother carved it for me. It fell from my pocket... near the old yew tree. In the churchyard."

My blood ran a little cold then. The churchyard. In the middle of a snowstorm, at night. But looking into that poor boy's desperate eyes, I knew I couldn't say no.

"Alright," I said, pulling my own coat from the hook. "I'll help you look. But we must be quick."

The wind howled as we stepped outside, but the blue light from his lantern pushed it back, creating a perfect, silent bubble around us. It was the most peculiar magic. We trudged through the deep snow, the two of us, a living woman and a silent little boy, towards the dark shape of the churchyard.

The yew tree was ancient, its branches heavy with snow, bowing to the earth like a supplicant. "It should be here," the boy said, his voice trembling.

We searched and searched, our hands growing numb, our breath pluming in the blue light. Just as I was about to give up hope, my fingers brushed against something small and hard in the snow. It was the little bird, exquisitely carved, its wings poised as if for flight.

I brushed the snow from it and held it out to him. His face lit up with a joy so pure it was like the sun had risen in the middle of the night. He took the bird, and as his fingers closed around it, he began to... fade.

The blue light of the lantern grew brighter, so bright I had to shield my eyes. Through my fingers, I saw the boy become transparent, like a reflection in water. He looked at me, and for the first time, he smiled. It was the most beautiful, heartbreaking smile I have ever seen.

"Thank you," he whispered, and his voice was now just an echo on the wind. "You've given me my Christmas back."

And then he was gone. The blue light shot up into the sky, a single, silent spark, and vanished.

I stood there for a long moment, alone in the hushed churchyard, the little wooden bird still clutched in my hand. That's when I looked down. My gaze fell upon the headstone right at my feet, the one hidden beneath the yew's lowest branch. The snow had partly melted away from the inscription, and in the faint light from the distant cottage, I could just make out the words:

*Silas Thorne*
*Beloved Son*
*1898 - 1905*

*leans forward, her own eyes misty with the memory*

I understood then. He wasn't lost in the storm of 1962. He had been lost for over fifty years. And on that one special night, the magic of Christmas had been strong enough to let him find what he'd been searching for all that time.

I never told a soul. Not even your great-grandfather. But I kept that little wooden bird. And every Christmas, I place it on the mantelpiece, right there, next to the photograph of you all.

Because that, my dears, is the truest magic of Christmas. It's a time for finding what was lost, for remembering those we love, and for a kindness so warm it can reach across the years.

Now... who thinks it's time for another cup of cocoa before we hang the stockings?
