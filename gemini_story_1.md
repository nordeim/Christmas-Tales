*I lean forward, the firelight catching the silver in my hair and the twinkle in my eye. The smell of roasted chestnuts and pine fills the room. I adjust the knitted shawl around my shoulders, looking at each of you to ensure you are settled. The wind howls outside, but here, we are safe.*

"Hush now, settle down. Pull that blanket up to your chin, Leo. There. That’s better.

You all look so full and content, with bellies full of turkey and plum pudding. But before your eyes drift shut, you must hear this. You asked for a story of the old days, but this isn't just a story about how we used to roast apples or sing carols. No, this is a story about the winter of 1934, a winter so cold the smoke froze in the chimneys, and the night I discovered the secret of the Iron Railway.

It was Christmas Eve, much like tonight. But back then, we lived in a small station master’s house at the edge of the dark, thick Blackwood Forest. My father—your Great-Grandfather—managed the tracks.

That night, a blizzard struck. It was a white wall of fury. The telegraph lines were down. No trains were scheduled to pass; the tracks were buried under three feet of snow. We had locked the doors and were warming our hands by the coal stove when, suddenly, the floorboards began to tremble.

*Thrum... thrum... thrum...*

The tea cups rattled in their saucers. My father stood up, his face pale. 'There’s nothing on the schedule,' he whispered. 'And nothing could push through this snow.'

But the sound grew louder. A rhythmic, metallic chugging that shook the very foundation of the house. I was a curious girl—much like you, Sophia—and I couldn't stay put. While my father grabbed his lantern and rushed out the front door, I slipped on my heavy boots and crept out the back.

There, standing on the tracks where the snow should have been impassable, was a train. But not just any train. It was jet black, sleek as a panther, with steam hissing from its underbelly that smelled not of coal, but of... cinnamon and ozone. The windows were frosted over, glowing with a warm, golden amber light.

I shouldn't have gone closer, but the intrigue pulled me in like a magnet. I waded through the snow, the wind biting my cheeks. As I neared the rear carriage, a window slid down.

A hand reached out. It was wearing a velvet glove, midnight blue. The hand held a small, brass mechanical bird. It dropped the bird into the snowbank right in front of me, and then, with a hiss of steam that sounded like a thousand whispering voices, the window slammed shut.

The whistle blew—a sound that didn't sound like a whistle, but like a choir holding a high note—and the train began to move. It didn't churn the snow; it seemed to glide *over* it, dissolving into the blizzard as if it were made of smoke.

I scrambled to the snowbank and dug out the brass bird. It was heavy, cold metal, but as I held it, it began to click. *Tick-whir-click.*

I ran back inside, hiding the object in my apron pocket. My father came back in moments later, shaking snow from his hat, looking bewildered. 'I saw lights,' he said, 'but no tracks. No tracks in the snow, Elara. It’s impossible.'

That night, in the safety of my attic room, I examined the bird. There was a tiny keyhole under its wing. I remembered the small silver key I wore on a necklace—a key I had found in the garden years prior that fit nothing in our house. My hands were trembling as I took the key off my neck and slid it into the bird.

*Click.*

The bird’s beak opened. It didn't sing. Instead, a small beam of light projected from its mouth, hitting the wall of my bedroom. It was a map. A map of our forest, but with a glowing X marking a spot near the frozen waterfall—a place the locals called the 'Whispering Cave.'

And there, scrolling in the light, were words: *'The Spirit of Christmas is not found, it is made. Keep the watch.'*

I never told my father. But the next morning, under the tree, there was a package wrapped in midnight blue paper. No tag. Inside was a set of watchmaker's tools—the finest I had ever seen.

I believe that train was the Midnight Express, the one that carries the dreams of the world to the North. And they chose me, for a reason I wouldn't understand until I became a clockmaker years later."

*I pause, leaning back into the armchair, watching your eyes grow wide.*

"And that brass bird? Well..."

*I reach into the pocket of my cardigan and pull out a tarnished, brass mechanical robin. I wind it once. It turns its head and looks at you, Sophia, and gives a soft, metallic chirp.*

"It still watches over us. Now, off to bed with you all. The magic only works if you're asleep."
